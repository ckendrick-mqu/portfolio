## Summary
A compact Java turn based dungeon crawler that blends class tactics and race matchups with equipment progression. It is easy to pick up, deep enough to reward strategic AP use, and intentionally built so new content slots in cleanly.

## Technical notes and design choices
The project uses inheritance to share core fields and behaviour in Character while subclassing for class specific stats and abilities. Dungeon is a recursive structure that holds an ArrayList of enemy Character objects so combat logic can treat all enemies uniformly. Equipment generation writes entries to a CSV for persistence and end of game reporting. The design favours clarity and extensibility so new classes, races or items can be added without changing dungeon or combat flow.

## How to play
Choose difficulty and follow on screen prompts. Select difficulty (Normal recommended) and choose a class. Enter a name and proceed through generated dungeons. Combat is turn based. Each turn you may perform a free attack or spend Ability Points (AP) to use a class special. Defeat enemies one by one to clear a dungeon, earn gold and equipment, then rest to restore Health Points (HP) and AP. Equip up to four items to aggregate their stat bonuses. Classes have unique mechanics such as invisibility for the Rogue, device building for the Engineer, and spell interactions for the Mage. Races create a Pokemon style advantage system that affects combat outcomes.

## How to run the program
Run client.java. Call the main function. Type numbers to make menu choices and press enter. Normal difficulty with option 2 and the Barbarian class with option 1 are recommended for first time players.
