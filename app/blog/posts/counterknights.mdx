## How to play
Storm the castle and kill everybody before the timer runs out to win.
Use WASD to move. Aim with mouse, shoot spells with left mouse button.
"Reload" your mana points with right click.
For better aiming stand still, shoot slower. 
There are no enemies in the sandy areas.

## Design focus
Recoil is the prototype's core design pillar and shapes every player decision. Movement is transform based so motion is deterministic and recoil remains predictable, while spells are prefab driven so damage, lifetime and spread can be tuned without changing core code. Enemy behaviour uses raycast line of sight to spawn projectile prefabs, keeping combat tight and performant. Tilemaps and a UI layer updated by gameplay scripts let level and HUD iteration happen quickly.

## Technical implementation
I prioritised WebGL stability and rapid iteration by avoiding heavy physics and complex camera systems. Manual collision handling and prefab instantiation made features fast to prototype, and audio layering provided dramatic weight without a large state machine. The main technical trade offs are runtime allocations from frequent Instantiate calls and predictable enemy patterns that reduce replay tension.

## Results and next steps
Playtests showed the recoil mechanic delivers skillful satisfaction, and the timer adds genuine drama, but players discover safe patterns over repeated runs. To address this I might implement object pooling to remove GC spikes, adding enemy behaviour variety and dynamic spawns to break routines, and adding gamepad support for broader accessibility.
